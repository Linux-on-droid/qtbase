Description: fix accessibility on XCB when running as root
 Accessibility actually works when running applications as root, but we
 would never properly connect, since the enabledChanged signal would be
 emitted from the constructor in this case. So after connecting the
 signal, check the value by hand to make sure not to miss the
 notification.
 .
 Only applications running as root would be affected, because all other
 applications would go through the asynchronous pattern of getting the
 bus address from dbus instead.
