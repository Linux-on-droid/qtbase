  * Drop unused dbus build-dependency.
  * Stop running pkgkde-mark-qt5-private-symbols script during build. The new
    way is that the maintainers run it themselves after each symbols update.
  * Make sure dh_installchangelogs is called even when upstream changelog is

  * Use wildcards instead of hardcoded ABI versions in Lintian overrides files.
  * Merge 5.5.1+dfsg-11 and 5.5.1+dfsg-12 unstable uploads.
    - Refresh patches.
  * When merging install files, take DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU into account, instead of
    DEB_HOST_ARCH. This is much more useful for us, because it allows us not to
    ship identical files for i386, hurd-i386 and kfreebsd-i386.

  * Update the symbols files using the script, and with build logs for amd64

  * Use the new pkgkde-mark-qt5-private-symbols script (which takes upstream
    version tags into account) from pkg-kde-tools ≥ 0.15.20.

  * Refresh patches: deppath_gnu.diff.
  * Bump Build-Depends-Indep qttools5-dev-tools dependency to << 5.1.0~.
  * Do not remove the include dir on cleaning the sources. Prior to Qt 5.1 perl
    would be run and re-create the includes. In 5.1, perl only runs if .git is
    found and the build is done out-of-source. Thanks Pino and Thiago for the
    hints.

  * Update symbols files with current build. The missing symbols seemed to be
    internal/private stuff and optional ones, so everything should be OK.
